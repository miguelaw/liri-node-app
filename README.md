Liri (node app)

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data like latest tweets from Twitter, movie info from OMDB, and/or songs from Spotify.
